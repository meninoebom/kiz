# Kizomba and Urban Kiz
The word Kizomba  comes from the Kimbundu language (or at least derives from it). Kimbundu, a Bantu language which has sometimes been called Mbundu or ‘North Mbundu’, is the second-most-widely-spoken Bantu language in Angola. The Angolan expression Kizombadas, used in the 50’s, referred to a big party. At that time, the word was not linked with a specific dance or music as it is today. Traditional dances like Semba, Kabetula , Kasukuta , Maringa, Caduque, Rebita, Cidralia , Dizanda ,  were predominant at that time. The majority of these dances are primarily carnaval dances. In Luanda, the Angolan capital, you can see almost all of these dances during the annual  “Carnaval da Victoria”. This carnaval and the carnaval from Lobito in the province of Benguela made these dances popular throughout  the whole nation.

Today Semba has evolved into a partner dance with large steps on a fast beat, and lots of room for playful improvisation. Traditionally, Semba was danced by men and women facing each other in lines, only touching at specific moments in the song through the hips.  The word ‘semba’ comes from ‘massemba’ meaning “to touch belly buttons” – a move that was traditionally done to show affection to a partner at social gatherings. In the 1990s, when the actual kizomba music got more and more popular, the steps of Semba were adapted to new music styles. How that new sound was forged is a topic of debate. The origins of kizomba music can be traced to the late-1970s in Angola. Kizomba is a slower more sensuous relative of of Angolan Semba and is said to have emerged as a fusion of Semba, Angolan Merengue, Kilapanga, and other Angolan music influences. It has also been said that it was influenced by Zouk, a musical movement pioneered by the French Antillean band Kassav’ in the early 1980s and by music that filtered in to Angola from Cape Verde in the 80’s and 90’s. Eduardo Paim is internationally recognized as the “father/creator of Kizomba music.”

Cape Verdean  immigrants who moved to France in the 1980s were exposed to Zouk music. They blended it with a traditional Cape Verdean styles like coldeira to create cola-zouk , similar to kizomba and typically sung in  Cape Verdean Creole.  

Urban Kiz is a couple dance derived from  kizomba. The origin is the result of exportation of kizomba abroad, as well the Angolan  diaspora introducing Kizomba to new contexts like Portugal, France, the UK, the Netherlands and Spain between 1980–2003. It was first popularized on YouTube and through early social media. 

Some say, Urban Kiz was created in Paris, France somewhere between 2012 and 2014 by Enah, Moun. Moun started dancing in 2008. Enah, in 2011. At first, the dance was called by different names, like Kizomba 2.0, French Style Kizomba, or New Style Kizomba. The style evolved under the influence of  Ghetto zouk*  and Kizomba remixes of popular R&B, and Hip Hop.  After heated debates about the use of the name Kizomba, in 2015, the new name Urban Kiz was created and publicly announced. Though there is some controversy around the origins of the style, it’s widely accepted that the brand Urban Kiz was pioneered in Paris by Enah, Moun & Curtis.

*Ghetto zouk is  a combination of zouk the dance style and R&B music. Ghetto Zouk music is probably one of the first you’ll hear when learning about kizomba. It is very similar to another dance style called Tarraxinha. In fact, a lot of Ghetto zouk songs have heavy Tarraxinha elements.

 Urban kiz has many branches and manifestations including some that have absorbed steps from influences as far-ranging as hip-hop and tango.  Although the fundamentals of kizomba are still important to Urban Kiz dancers, the technique and body movements are very different from Kizomba.
